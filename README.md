[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS)

## Version 3.7.2

- [Changelog](http://www.hockeyapp.net/help/sdk/ios/3.7.2/docs/docs/Changelog.html)

## Introduction

HockeySDK-iOS implements support for using HockeyApp in your iOS applications.

The following features are currently supported:

1. **Collect crash reports:** If your app crashes, a crash log with the same format as from the Apple Crash Reporter is written to the device's storage. If the user starts the app again, he is asked to submit the crash report to HockeyApp. This works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store!
I
2. **Update Ad-Hoc / Enterprise apps:** The app will check with HockeyApp if a new version for your Ad-Hoc or Enterprise build is available. If yes, it will show an alert view to the user and let him see the release notes, the version history and start the installation process right away. 

3. **Update notification for app store:** The app will check if a new version for your app store release is available. If yes, it will show an alert view to the user and let him open your app in the App Store app. (Disabled by default!)

4. **Feedback:** Collect feedback from your users from within your app and communicate directly with them using the HockeyApp backend.

5. **Authenticate:** Identify and authenticate users of Ad-Hoc or Enterprise builds

<a id="requirements"></a> 
## 1. Requirements

1. We assume that you already have a project in Xcode and that this project is opened in Xcode 6 or later.
2. The SDK supports iOS 6.0 and later.

<a id="setup"></a>
## 2. Setup

We recommend integration of our binary into your Xcode project to setup HockeySDK for your iOS app. You can also use our interactive SDK integration wizard in <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/mac/">HockeyApp for Mac</a> which covers all the steps from below. For other ways to setup the SDK, see [Advanced Setup](#advancedsetup).

### 2.1 Obtain an App Identifier

Please see the "[How to create a new app](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/about-general-faq/how-to-create-a-new-app)" tutorial. This will provide you with an HockeyApp specific App Identifier to be used to initialize the SDK.

### 2.2 Download the SDK

1. Download the latest [HockeySDK-iOS](http://www.hockeyapp.net/releases/) framework which is provided as a zip-File.
2. Unzip the file and you will see a folder called `HockeySDK-iOS`. (Make sure not to use 3rd party unzip tools!)

### 2.3 Copy the SDK into your projects directory in Finder

From our experience, 3rd-party libraries usually reside inside a subdirectory (let's call our subdirectory `Vendor`), so if you don't have your project organized with a subdirectory for libraries, now would be a great start for it. To continue our example,  create a folder called `Vendor` inside your project directory and move the unzipped `HockeySDK-iOS`-folder into it. 

<a id="setupxcode"></a>
### 2.4 Set up the SDK in Xcode

1. We recommend to use Xcode's group-feature to create a group for 3rd-party-libraries similar to the structure of our files on disk. For example,  similar to the file structure in 2.3 above, our projects have a group called `Vendor`.
2. Make sure the `Project Navigator` is visible (⌘+1)
3. The SDK comes in three flavours:
	1. Full featured `HockeySDK.embeddedframework`
	2. Crash reporting only `HockeySDK.framework` in the subfolder `HockeySDKCrashOnly`
	3. Crash reporting only for extensions `HockeySDK.framework` in the subfolder `HockeySDKCrashOnlyExtension` (which is required to be used for extensions when build into native frameworks).
	
	Our examples will use the full featured one.
4. Drag & drop `HockeySDK.embeddedframework` from your window in the `Finder` into your project in Xcode and move it to the desired location in the `Project Navigator` (e.g. into the group called `Vendor`)
5. A popup will appear. Select `Create groups for any added folders` and set the checkmark for your target. Then click `Finish`.

<a id="modifycode"></a>
### 2.5 Modify Code 

**Objective-C**

1. Open your `AppDelegate.m` file.
2. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own `import` statements:

    ```objectivec
    @import HockeySDK;
    ```

3. Search for the method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
4. Add the following lines to setup and start the Application Insights SDK:

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
    // Do some additional configuration if needed here
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].authenticator authenticateInstallation]; // This line is obsolete in the crash only builds
    ```

**Swift**

1. Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file.
2. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own import statements:
    
    ```swift
    import HockeySDK
    ```

3. Search for the method 
    
    ```swift
    application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:[NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool
    ```

4. Add the following lines to setup and start the Application Insights SDK:
    
    ```swift
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().configureWithIdentifier("APP_IDENTIFIER");
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().startManager();
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().authenticator.authenticateInstallation(); // This line is obsolete in the crash only builds
    ```

*Note:* The SDK is optimized to defer everything possible to a later time while making sure e.g. crashes on startup can also be caught and each module executes other code with a delay some seconds. This ensures that `applicationDidFinishLaunching` will process as fast as possible and the SDK will not block the startup sequence resulting in a possible kill by the watchdog process.

**Congratulation, now you're all set to use HockeySDK!**

## 3. Advanced Setup

<a id="linkmanually"></a>
### 3.1 Linking System Frameworks manually

If you are working with an older project which doesn't support clang modules yet or you for some reason turned off the `Enable Modules (C and Objective-C` and `Link Frameworks Automatically` options in Xcode, you have to manually link some system frameworks:

1. Select your project in the `Project Navigator` (⌘+1).
2. Select your app target.
3. Select the tab `Build Phases`.
4. Expand `Link Binary With Libraries`.
5. Add the following system frameworks, if they are missing:
  1. Full Featured: 
    + `AssetsLibrary`
    + `CoreText`
    + `CoreGraphics`
    + `Foundation`
    + `MobileCoreServices`
    + `QuartzCore`
    + `QuickLook`
    + `Security`
    + `SystemConfiguration`
    + `UIKit`
    + `libc++`
  2. Crash reporting only:
    + `Foundation`
    + `Security`
    + `SystemConfiguration`
    + `UIKit`
    + `libc++`
  2. Crash reporting only for extensions:
    + `Foundation`
    + `Security`
    + `SystemConfiguration`
    + `libc++`

Note that this also means that you can't use the `@import` syntax mentioned in the [Modify Code](#modify) section but have to stick to the old `#import <HockeySDK/HockeySDK.h>`.

<a id="cocoapods"></a>
### 3.2 Setup with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like HockeySDK in your projects. To learn how to setup CocoaPods for your project, visit the [official CocoaPods website](http://cocoapods.org/).

**Podfile**

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod "HockeySDK"
```

#### 3.2.1 Binary Distribution Options

The default and recommended distribution is a binary (static library) and a resource bundle with translations and images for all SDK Features: Crash Reporting, User Feedback, Store Updates, Authentication, AdHoc Updates.

You can alternative use a Crash Reporting build only by using the following line in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "HockeySDK", :subspecs => ['CrashOnlyLib']
```

Or you can use the Crash Reporting build only for extensions by using the following line in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "HockeySDK", :subspecs => ['CrashOnlyExtensionsLib']
```

#### 3.2.2 Source Integration Options

Alternatively you can integrate the SDK by source if you want to do any modifications or want a different feature set. The following entry will integrate the SDK:

```ruby
pod "HockeySDK-Source"
```


<a id="extensions"></a>
### 3.3 iOS 8 Extensions

The following points need to be considered to use the HockeySDK SDK with iOS 8 Extensions:

1. Each extension is required to use the same values for version (`CFBundleShortVersionString`) and build number (`CFBundleVersion`) as the main app uses. (This is required only if you are using the same `APP_IDENTIFIER` for your app and extensions).
2. You need to make sure the SDK setup code is only invoked **once**. Since there is no `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` equivalent and `viewDidLoad` can run multiple times, you need to use a setup like the following example:

    ```objectivec
    @interface TodayViewController () <NCWidgetProviding>

    @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL didSetupHockeySDK;

    @end

    @implementation TodayViewController

    * (void)viewDidLoad {
      [super viewDidLoad];
      if (!self.didSetupHockeySDK) {
        [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
        [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
        self.didSetupHockeySDK = YES;
      }
    }
    ```

3. The binary distribution provides a special framework build in the `HockeySDKCrashOnly` or `HockeySDKCrashOnlyExtension` folder of the distribution zip file, which only contains crash reporting functionality (also automatic sending crash reports only).


<a id="watchkit"></a>
### 3.4 WatchKit 1 Extensions

The following points need to be considered to use HockeySDK with WatchKit 1 Extensions:

1. WatchKit extensions don't use regular `UIViewControllers` but rather `WKInterfaceController` subclasses. These have a different lifecycle than you might be used to.

   To make sure that the HockeySDK is only instantiated once in the WatchKit extension's lifecycle we recommend using a helper class similar to this:

    ```objectivec
    @import Foundation;
    
    @interface BITWatchSDKSetup : NSObject
    
    - (void)setupHockeySDKIfNeeded;
    
    @end
    ```
        
    ```objectivec
    #import "BITWatchSDKSetup.h"
    @import HockeySDK
    
    static BOOL hockeySDKIsSetup = NO;
    
    @implementation BITWatchSDKSetup
    
    - (void)setupHockeySDKIfNeeded {
      if (!hockeySDKIsSetup) {
        [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
        [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
        hockeySDKIsSetup = YES;
      }
    }
    
    @end
    ```

   Then, in each of your WKInterfaceControllers where you want to use the Application Insights SDK, you should do this:

    ```objectivec
    #import "InterfaceController.h"
    @import HockeySDK
    #import "BITWatchSDKSetup.h"
    
    @implementation InterfaceController
    
    * (void)awakeWithContext:(id)context {
      [super awakeWithContext:context];
      [BITWatchSDKSetup setupHockeySDKIfNeeded];
    }
    
    * (void)willActivate {
      [super willActivate];
    }
    
    * (void)didDeactivate {
      [super didDeactivate];
    }
    
    @end
    ```

2. The binary distribution provides a special framework build in the `HockeySDKCrashOnly` or `HockeySDKCrashOnlyExtension` folder of the distribution zip file, which only contains crash reporting functionality (also automatic sending crash reports only).

<a name="crashreporting"></a>
### 3.5 Crash Reporting

The following options only show some of possibilities to interact and fine-tune the crash reporting feature. For more please check the full documentation of the `BITCrashManager` class in our [documentation](#documentation).

#### 3.5.1 Disable Crash Reporting
The HockeySDK enables crash reporting **per default**. Crashes will be immediately sent to the server the next time the app is launched.

To provide you with the best crash reporting, we are using [PLCrashReporter]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter") in [Version 1.2 / Commit 356901d7f3ca3d46fbc8640f469304e2b755e461]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter/commit/356901d7f3ca3d46fbc8640f469304e2b755e461").

This feature can be disabled as follows:

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDisableCrashManager: YES]; //disable crash reporting

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

#### 3.5.2 Autosend crash reports

Crashes are send the next time the app starts. If `crashManagerStatus` is set to `BITCrashManagerStatusAutoSend`, crashes will be send without any user interaction, otherwise an alert will appear allowing the users to decide whether they want to send the report or not.

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].crashManager setCrashManagerStatus: BITCrashManagerStatusAutoSend];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

The SDK is not sending the reports right when the crash happens deliberately, because if is not safe to implement such a mechanism while being async-safe (any Objective-C code is _NOT_ async-safe!) and not causing more danger like a deadlock of the device, than helping. We found that users do start the app again because most don't know what happened, and you will get by far most of the reports.

Sending the reports on startup is done asynchronously (non-blocking). This is the only safe way to ensure that the app won't be possibly killed by the iOS watchdog process, because startup could take too long and the app could not react to any user input when network conditions are bad or connectivity might be very slow.

#### 3.5.3 Mach Exception Handling

By default the SDK is using the safe and proven in-process BSD Signals for catching crashes. This option provides an option to enable catching fatal signals via a Mach exception server instead.

We strongly advice _NOT_ to enable Mach exception handler in release versions of your apps!

*Warning:* The Mach exception handler executes in-process, and will interfere with debuggers when they attempt to suspend all active threads (which will include the Mach exception handler). Mach-based handling should _NOT_ be used when a debugger is attached. The SDK will not enabled catching exceptions if the app is started with the debugger running. If you attach the debugger during runtime, this may cause issues the Mach exception handler is enabled!
 
```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].crashManager setEnableMachExceptionHandler: YES];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

#### 3.5.4 Attach additional data

The `BITHockeyManagerDelegate` protocol provides methods to add additional data to a crash report:

1. UserID: `- (NSString *)userIDForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`
2. UserName: `- (NSString *)userNameForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`
3. UserEmail: `- (NSString *)userEmailForHockeyManager:(BITHockeyManager *)hockeyManager componentManager:(BITHockeyBaseManager *)componentManager;`

The `BITCrashManagerDelegate` protocol (which is automatically included in `BITHockeyManagerDelegate`) provides methods to add more crash specific data to a crash report:

1. Text attachments: `-(NSString *)applicationLogForCrashManager:(BITCrashManager *)crashManager`

   Check the following tutorial for an example on how to add CocoaLumberjack log data: [How to Add Application Specific Log Data on iOS or OS X](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x/how-to-add-application-specific-log-data-on-ios-or-os-x)
2. Binary attachments: `-(BITHockeyAttachment *)attachmentForCrashManager:(BITCrashManager *)crashManager`

Make sure to implement the protocol

```objectivec
@interface YourAppDelegate () <BITHockeyManagerDelegate> {}

@end
```

and set the delegate:

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDelegate: self];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

 
<a name="feedback"></a>
### 3.6 Feedback

`BITFeedbackManager` lets your users communicate directly with you via the app and an integrated user interface. It provides a single threaded discussion with a user running your app. This feature is only enabled, if you integrate the actual view controllers into your app.
 
You should never create your own instance of `BITFeedbackManager` but use the one provided by the `[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager]`:
 
```objectivec
[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].feedbackManager
```

Please check the [documentation](#documentation) of the `BITFeedbachManager` class on more information on how to leverage this feature.

<a name="storeupdates"></a>
### 3.7 Store Updates

This is the HockeySDK module for handling app updates when having your app released in the App Store.

When an update is detected, this module will show an alert asking the user if he/she wants to update or ignore this version. If update was chosen, it will open the apps page in the app store app.

By default this module is **NOT** enabled! To enable it use the following code:

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setEnableStoreUpdateManager: YES];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

When this module is enabled and **NOT** running in an App Store build/environment, it won't do any checks!

Please check the [documentation](#documentation) of the `BITStoreUpdateManager` class on more information on how to leverage this feature and know about its limits.

<a name="betaupdates"></a>
### 3.8 In-App-Updates (Beta & Enterprise only)

The following options only show some of possibilities to interact and fine-tune the update feature when using Ad-Hoc or Enterprise provisioning profiles. For more please check the full documentation of the `BITUpdateManager` class in our [documentation](#documentation).

The feature handles version updates, presents update and version information in a App Store like user interface, collects usage information and provides additional authorization options when using Ad-Hoc provisioning profiles.

This module automatically disables itself when running in an App Store build by default!

This feature can be disabled manually as follows:

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDisableUpdateManager: YES]; //disable crash reporting

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

If you want to see beta analytics, use the beta distribution feature with in-app updates, restrict versions to specific users, or want to know who is actually testing your app, you need to follow the instructions on our guide [Authenticating Users on iOS](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x/authenticating-users-on-ios)

<a id="debug"></a>
### 3.9 Debug information

To check if data is send properly to HockeyApp and also see some additional SDK debug log data in the console, add the following line before `startManager`:

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDebugLogEnabled:YES];

[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```
